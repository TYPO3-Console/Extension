# TYPO3 Console Extension (read only)

This repository is automatically updated for every change
in the [original](https://github.com/TYPO3-Console/TYPO3-Console/) repository.

[Issue tracking](https://github.com/TYPO3-Console/TYPO3-Console/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/TYPO3-Console/TYPO3-Console/pulls)
can also be found there.

This repository is mainly to properly render the documentation on typo3.org infrastructure,
but can also be used to get the latest development state as TYPO3 extension.
Use the latter at your own risk.
Composer installation of [helhum/typo3-console](https://packagist.org/packages/helhum/typo3-console)
should always be preferred.
